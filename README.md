# Financial Data Analysis App

To run locally, clone the repo, cd into the directory, and run 'npm install'. In the root directory, you'll need to create a .env file to store the API key which you can obtain from Financial Modeling Prep. Save the key under the variable VITE_API_KEY. Then you can run 'npm run dev' and open localhost in your browser at whichever port is specified by the terminal.
